# augmented_c

> Not really c

Ulitmately this will probably be a project that will be
abondoned sooner or later, but this project that came about
as I dislike C's lack of typesafety and abstraction but I
appreshiate it's low level ness, so I made something somewhere
between...


## Features

Kind like C with

- ML modules
- lamdbas
- parametic types
- higher kind types
- tagged unions
- checked 
- null safety
- high interopablity with c
  - call able from c with no runtime setup, just include object files.
  - can call c

## Similarities with C

- No runtime overhead
- deal with pointers

## Why

mostly for fun, not really a language I'd encourage others to use...
